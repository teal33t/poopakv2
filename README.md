Poopak is an open source research project with focus on dark net markets and hidden services.

We're looking into how anonymous decentralized networks aided free speech and how a combination of anonymous decentralized networks like Tor Network or I2P and transparent money transactions like Bitcoin can provide a society with a foundation for transitioning from a state market to a free market.
